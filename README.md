Basic Swap Sequence.  A swap sequence is defined as the series of index-swaps
needed to transform A into B, where A and B are different orderings of the same
set of elements.

Thus, a permutation of A can be described as A + Swaps(A).

The swap sequences are useful when writing PSO algorithms for TSP.
